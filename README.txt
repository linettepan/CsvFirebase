Things to include that don’t require specific formatting
name, description, address, city, state, start_time, end_time, start_date, end_date, photo_name

PAY ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING FOR FORMATTING
End_date: “YYYY-MM-DD” --------- please make sure that you include dashes between. You just input the numbers and dashes, so everything between the quotation marks(e.g. 2018-01-24)

End_time: “HH:MM” --------- make sure to put a colon between the hour and minute fields, hour is based on 24 hour clock, so 1pm is 13:00

Start_date: “YYYY-MM-DD”

Start_time: “HH:MM”
